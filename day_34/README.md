# Day 34 - Started A New Project With Rocket and PostgreSQL

I started a new project today. I am using Rocket and PostgreSQL for this project. I have used Rocket before but this is the first time I am using PostgreSQL. I have used MySQL and SQLite before but never PostgreSQL. I am excited to learn something new.

I have used Diesel ORM for PostgreSQL. I have used it before with SQLite. It is a great ORM. I am using it with Rocket for this project.

# Task

- For Today, just create a new project with `cargo new` and learn about PostgreSQL and Diesel ORM.
